Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

The main class is the main character/player and the Stand user class represents the user with abilities with choices of performing actions such as grab(), drop(), use(), and etc.. along with performing those actions on the items that can increase or decrease their skills.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface? 

I did implement any new methods. If I had more time, I would like to make a method that allows them to choose a stand(spirtual being with powers from Jojo's Bizare Adventure)


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was that I consulted with a friend for help, and what didn't work was that I didn't know how to make the undo method reverse the other methods into their previous state.
